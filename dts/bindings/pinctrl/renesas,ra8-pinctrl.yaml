    The Renesas RA pin controller is a node responsible for controlling
    pin function selection and pin properties, such as routing a SCI0 Rx
    to P100 and enabling the pullup resistor on that pin.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
       * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
       */

      /* include pre-defined combinations for the SoC variant used by the board */
      #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/renesas/ra-pinctrl.h>

      &pinctrl {
        /* configuration for the usart0 "default" state */
        sci0_default: sci0_default {
          /* group 1 */
          group1 {
            /* configure P101 as SCI0 TX */
            psels = <UART0_TX_P101>;
          };
          /* group 2 */
          group2 {
            /* configure P100 as SCI0 RX */
            psels = <UART0_RX_P100>;
            /* enable input on pin 100 */
            input-enable;
          };
        };
      };

    The 'sci0_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
    particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
    state.

    As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
    Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'psels'
    property.

    A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
    pins, such as the 'input-enable' property in group 2. Here is a list of
    supported standard pin properties:

    - bias-disable: Disable pull-up/down (default, not required).
    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
    - input-enable: Enable input from the pin.
    - drive-strength: Set the drive strength of the pin. Possible
      values are: low, median, highspeed-high, high.

    To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
    number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

       #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

       &uart0 {
             pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
             pinctrl-1 = <&uart0_sleep>;
             pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
       };

          The drive strength of a pin. The default value is low, as this
          is the power on reset value.
