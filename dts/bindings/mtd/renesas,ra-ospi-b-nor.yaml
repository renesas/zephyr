properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  channel:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The OSPI channel to which flash memory is connected.

  protocol-mode:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
     The width of OSPI bus to which flash memory is connected.

     Possible values are :
      - OSPI_SPI_MODE  <1> = SPI mode on 1 data line
      - OSPI_DUAL_MODE <2> = Dual mode on 2 data lines
      - OSPI_QUAD_MODE <4> = Quad mode on 4 data lines
      - OSPI_OPI_MODE  <8> = Octo mode on 8 data lines
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8

  data-rate:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
     The SPI data Rate is STR or DTR

     Possible values are :
      - OSPI_STR_TRANSFER <1> = Single Rate Transfer
      - OSPI_DTR_TRANSFER <2> = Dual Rate Transfer (only with OSPI_OPI_MODE)
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2

  ospi-max-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Max frequency input on OSPI

  spi-word-data-swapped:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether word data is swapped in the spi transaction. If true, the byte
      order of each word is swapped.

  erase-block-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      The flash controller is limited by hardware to erase whole blocks of flash
      at a time. This property describes the largest erase block size in erase-blocks.
